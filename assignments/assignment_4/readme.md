# Assignment 4 - AES Implementation

## Implement AES 128.


Notes:  

1. Implement each operator used in AES as separate functions, including the key expansion function. Each of these operators should be independently verifiable.
2. The output should be in the form of the screenshot attached below.
3. I should be able to check your code for any number of round, i.e. the number of rounds (1---10) should be a user input.
