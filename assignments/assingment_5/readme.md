# Assignment 5 - ElGamal Digital Signature Scheme

## For the last assignment you need to Implement the ElGamal Digital Signature Scheme..

- Your implementation should have the following three functions.


=======================================================================================
- Key Generation

- Signature Generation
A generates a signature for a message m (0 ≤ m < p−1) 

- Signature Verification
A signature (r, s) produced by A can be verified
================================================================================================

- For verification, you may use the example given in the DR Stinson's book.
